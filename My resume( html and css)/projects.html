        <h2>ðŸ”§ ECO-PRINT</h2>
            ECO-PRINT project focused on sustainable 3D printing technology by converting PET plastic bottles into usable filament material. This initiative aimed to reduce plastic waste while offering a cost-effective solution for 3D printing. As part of the team, I contributed to the mechanical design and processing workflow that ensured the PET bottles were efficiently shredded, melted, and extruded into filament compatible with standard 3D printers. This project not only demonstrated environmental responsibility but also highlighted innovation in material reuse.

            <h2>ðŸ’» Design and Verification of a 32-bit Floating Point Multiplier using Verilog HDL</h2>
            In this project, we implemented a 32-bit Floating Point Multiplier adhering to the IEEE 754 standard using Verilog HDL. The goal was to build a high-performance, reliable arithmetic unit for digital systems. My responsibilities included writing the RTL (Register Transfer Level) code and verifying the design through simulation using testbenches. This project deepened my understanding of digital design concepts such as normalization, rounding, and exception handling, and enhanced my skills in HDL-based hardware development and functional verification.

            <h2>ðŸŒ± ECO-FRIENDLY 3D PRINTER</h2>
            The Eco-Friendly 3D Printer project involved constructing a 3D printer using e-waste components, with the additional goal of printing models using biodegradable materials. This project emphasized both electronics reuse and sustainable material usage. I was actively involved in assembling hardware parts salvaged from discarded electronics, integrating control systems, and calibrating the printer. This initiative was recognized for its innovative and eco-conscious approach, reinforcing the importance of sustainable engineering practices.

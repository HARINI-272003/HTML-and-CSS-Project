        <h3>During my academic journey, I have had the opportunity to gain hands-on industry experience through internships that deepened my technical knowledge and practical understanding of key engineering concepts.</h3>
        <br>
        <h2>üîåRoomans Technologies Pvt. Ltd.</h2>
        I undertook an internship as a VLSI Design Engineer at Rooman Technologies Private Limited, spanning from September 2024 to February 2025. This experience introduced me to the complete flow of Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) design, including RTL (Register Transfer Level) design and verification. I learned to write and verify digital logic designs using industry-relevant tools, allowing me to bridge theoretical knowledge with real-time application. This role also gave me a clear understanding of design constraints, synthesis, and timing analysis.
        <br>
        My responsibilities extended into physical design, where I explored how the logical structure of circuits is translated into physical layouts on silicon chips. The exposure to back-end processes such as floorplanning, placement, and routing sharpened my grasp on chip design and broadened my interest in semiconductor technology. Working in a professional setting helped me develop discipline, attention to detail, and the ability to collaborate with senior engineers on complex tasks.

        <h2>üîçAqmenz Automation Pvt. Ltd.</h2>
        In another enriching opportunity, I interned at Aqmenz Automation Private Limited from October 25, 2023, to November 24, 2023. Here, I worked on a project titled "Detect Questions using Python", where I built a machine learning model to identify interrogative sentences. This involved applying natural language processing techniques and developing algorithms to parse sentence structures. Through this internship, I gained hands-on experience in Python programming, data preprocessing, and model evaluation, which enhanced my understanding of artificial intelligence and its linguistic applications.
        <br>
        Together, these internships have shaped my technical foundation and problem-solving abilities across both hardware and software domains. They allowed me to apply classroom learning to real-world scenarios, deepening my interest in both VLSI and machine learning. These experiences not only refined my technical skills but also strengthened my teamwork, time management, and adaptability‚Äîqualities essential for success in the tech industry.

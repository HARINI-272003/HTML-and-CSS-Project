        <h4>üß© 1. Who I Am</h4>
        I‚Äôm S Harini, an enthusiastic Electronics and Communication Engineering student with a strong academic foundation and a deep interest in innovation and problem-solving. Currently pursuing my Bachelor‚Äôs degree at East West College of Engineering, I have maintained an excellent CGPA of 9.1 and consistently strived for both academic excellence and practical growth.
        <br>
        <h4>üíª 2. Technical Passion</h4>
        I am passionate about electronics design, embedded systems, and programming. My technical toolkit includes languages like C, Python, Verilog, Java, and tools like VLSI Design & Testing. I‚Äôve worked on projects ranging from floating-point multipliers in Verilog to eco-friendly 3D printing using PET bottle filament, which reflect both my technical knowledge and sustainability mindset.
        <br>
        <h4>üß™ 3. Project-Driven Learning</h4>
        My learning style is highly project-oriented. Notable among my works are the ECO-PRINT project, where we converted waste PET bottles into usable 3D printing filament, and the Design and Verification of a 32-bit Floating Point Multiplier using Verilog HDL, conforming to IEEE 754 standards. These projects helped me translate theoretical knowledge into real-world applications while boosting my problem-solving and hardware design skills.
        <br>
        <h4>üë©‚Äçüíº 4. Industry Exposure</h4>
        I‚Äôve enhanced my skills through hands-on internships at Rooman Technologies and Aqmenz Automation, where I gained experience in RTL design, verification, and Python-based machine learning. These roles gave me practical exposure to core engineering workflows and helped me collaborate with industry professionals on live projects.
        <br>
        <h4>üèÜ 5. Leadership & Soft Skills</h4>
        Beyond academics and tech, I actively contributed to social outreach programs such as the AICTE awareness campaign for rural schools and Swachh Bharath Abhiyan, leading a team of four. I was also honored with the Srishti Avishkar award for my work on eco-friendly 3D printing. My journey so far has nurtured strong communication, teamwork, adaptability, and a mindset focused on continuous learning.
